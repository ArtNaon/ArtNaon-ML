Welcome to the ArtNaon Machine Learning Model Development project! This project aims to create a sophisticated image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our model not only classifies images but also provides descriptions and recommends similar images from a pre-existing dataset. Finally, we deploy our model on Cloud Run using Flask.

## Introduction
In the realm of art, classifying images and providing relevant descriptions can greatly enhance the user experience. Our project utilizes CNN architecture to classify images efficiently and leverages recommendation systems for suggesting similar artworks. The final model is deployed on Cloud Run, making it accessible and scalable.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classify images using a CNN model.
- **Image Description**: Generate descriptions for classified images.
- **Image Recommendations**: Recommend similar images from previously uploaded images.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the model using Flask on Cloud Run.

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArtNaon/ArtNaon-ML.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ArtNaon-ML
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Model Architecture
We employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The architecture includes several convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers to ensure high accuracy in classification tasks. After classification, the model generates descriptions and recommends similar images from a pre-existing dataset.

## Deployment
The model is deployed on Google Cloud Run using Flask. This allows for scalable and efficient access to the model's capabilities.
